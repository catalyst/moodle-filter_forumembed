## Usage

1. Create a discussion thread within a forum in your chosen course.
2. Add `{discussion:<Your discussion name>}` e.g. `{discussion:Topic #1}` to text anywhere on a course.

When the text is displayed it will be replaced with the discussion thread.

You can use CSS to modify the look and feel of the discussion thread, the embed is surrounded with a div that has the CSS class `path-filter-forumembed`.
